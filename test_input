just writing a bunch of test strings
having so much fun doing this
really.. having so much fun
yay.. ?
...
.
******
ok i think im done ?
but not sure maybe i should test a few more strings, cuz earlier i kept finding strings that didnt pass, like the empty string for example, and i had to fix that, i also found that a super long string kinda like this one, at least one that is greater in length than the length of a CHUNK that the hashing algorithms chunk the message in, breaks the function, it had to with the fact that ft_strncpy() doesn't terminate strings if the string passed in is equal or greator in length to the variable n. anyways i think this string is long enough to be a good test for md5 through to sha256 and then also for sha384 and sha512.. peace.
ok im out of things to test i think
ill just let you try your inputs i guess
i hope i covered the edge cases possible
alright done, cu
